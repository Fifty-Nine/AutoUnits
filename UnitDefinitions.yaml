# The base units. These define the dimensions for the unit system
# as well as the base units for those dimensions.
# 
# The format for each entry is:
# [ name of dimension, name of base unit for that dimension ]
#
BaseUnits:
  - [ Second, Time ]
  - [ Kilogram, Mass ]
  - [ Meter, Distance ]
  - [ Celsius, Temperature ]

# The derived units. These define additional units in terms of the base units of
# the unit system. 
#
# The format for each entry is:
#   name: name of derived base unit
#   units: the derivation of the units (e.g., Meters / Second, 1 / Second)
#
# Only base units and "1" are allowed to appear in the derivation expression.
#
DerivedUnits:
  - name: MetersPerSecond
    derivation: Meters / Second

  - name: MeterSquared
    derivation: Meter * Meter

# Everything else. These define additional units for the system and conversions
# to the base units. 
#
# The format for each entry is:
#   name: name of the unit
#   base: base unit (may be from DerivedUnits)
#   conversion: the conversion from the unit to the base unit.
#
# For most units, the conversion will be a scalar value by which the the value 
# is multiplied to obtain the base. For more complex conversions, the keyword 
# 'value' can be used to define a conversion function, like so:
#
# conversion: (value - 32) * 5.0 / 9.0
#
# where the 'value' keyword represents the value of the quantity in the defined
# units and the result of the expression should yield the value of the quantity
# in base units. In this version, all conversions are assumed to be symmetric.
